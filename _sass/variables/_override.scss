// Variables
//
// Leave the '_default.scss' variables as they are. If you need to override 
// a specific variable, include it in this file with the same name. 
// 
// This is helpful if you are modifying the theme for a specific use case but want
// to leave the parent theme in tact.
//
// Variables should follow the `$component-state-property-size` formula for
// consistent naming. Ex: $nav-link-disabled-color and $modal-content-box-shadow-xs.
